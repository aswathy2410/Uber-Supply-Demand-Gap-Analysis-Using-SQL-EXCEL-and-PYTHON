# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Analysis-Using-SQL-EXCEL-and-PYTHON
The project analyses Uber trip data to understand when there are more ride requests than available drivers. By examining trips statuses, driver availabilities, and time segments throughout the day, the project aims to identify times and areas with supply and demand gaps. The goal is to find patterns and help provide suggestion to improve driver availability during busy times.  The initial data preprocessing is already done in SQL. Basic data analysis was then done in Excel and the dashboards are created to understand the data, and identify the supply-demand gap. Here, in the notebook file, detailed temporal analysis will be done to identify the peak time for requests and the availability of drivers during the same time frame.

The analysis is done in 3 phases:

SQL – Data Preprocessing

Excel – Dashboard Creation

Python – EDA
